<h2>Using the table</h2>

<p>
Much of the data in the table comes from UCAS forms, which are accessible
by clicking on the candidate's name.  Qualification summaries are provided
for convenience in the table itself; not all qualifications are
summarized.  If you notice a particularly important one which is missing,
or doesn't display correctly, please let the admissions coordinator know.
</p>

<p>
It has been noticed that some features don't work in some older browsers.
The application has been developed and more thoroughly tested in
Firefox, Chrome, and (to a lesser extent) Safari.
</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>
Two filters are provided:  a blank for arbitrary text, and a filter
for college lists and places.  The list displayed is the intersection
of the two filters.
</p>

<p>
The text filter is applied to names,
but also to a number of other fields including college places,
status, qualifications summary (but not the detailed information), etc.
</p>

<p>
The college filter requires both a college to be selected as well as
one or more checkboxes.
</p>

<h3>Sorting</h3>

<p>
Sortable columns have small grey arrows in the header.  These can be
clicked to sort the column.
</p>

<p>
Multi-column sorts can be made by first selecting one column, and then
adding another column by holding the shift key down while clicking on
the other column.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
Blanks for interview marks should be available during the
interview period.  In order to use them, make sure you
have the &quot;Edit&quot; columns are available.
</p>

<p>
Decimals are allowed for interview marks, but should be
entered with a &quot;.&quot; rather than a comma.
Commas will not be recognized.
</p>

<h3>Interview marks</h3>

<p>
i1 and i2 are for interviews in the first-choice college.
i3 is for the interview mark in the second-choice college.
</p>

<p>
i4 is reserved for a philosophy interview in the first-choice
college, and i5 for the second-choice college, in the case
of physics &amp; philosophy candidates.  Use the same
marking range (1-10) as for the physics interviews.
Note that these marks do not contribute to the Jelley score.
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>
The comment column is indicated by an &amp; sign.  The number
indicates the number of comments which have been left for this candidate.
When you enter text in the blank, remember that you may need to
click outside the box to gain access to the &quot;Save state&quot; button.
Comments will be available to all users of the admissions system.
</p>

<p>
Use the comments section to amend candidate information.  For instance,
if a student indicates a physical disability during a first interview, but not
in the UCAS form, it will help the second college interviewer to plan
reasonable accommodation.
</p>

<p>
Make sure the check the comments section to see if there is any
further context you shoud know about the candidate.
</p>

<h2>Interview schedules</h2>

<p>
This year, we will continue the practice of collecting interview schedules
from the colleges and posting them in a shared area.
